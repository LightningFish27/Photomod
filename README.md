PhotoMod (PM) is a highly-modular, cross-platform image manipulation toolset, which is based on 3 principles:

-Modularity: users can customize nearly their entire PM experience through the installation of different "Modules," which while individually responsible for only a small part of the program's functionality, combine to create a infinitely variable program. 

-Aesthetics: user experience is a vital part of a program's useability, and by extension its usefulness. Because of this, PM provides a module API which is translated by the program into an interface matching its overall theme. 

-Flexibility: although similar to modularity, this principle refers to the rapid pace at which module developers should be able to create their modules. Modules should be able to be written with minimal architectural considerations in regards to their inclusion in PM, and focus more so on the artistic control they provide a user.
